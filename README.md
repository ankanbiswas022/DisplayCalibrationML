# DisplayCalibrationML
This folder contains all the necessary files needed to display colors: RGB and Gray at 11 intensity levels between 0 to 1 using MonkeyLogic(ML).
The task can run in two modes: 
(1) Display calibration mode: In this mode, stimulus would be displayed and Spectroradiometer(PR-655) would measure and save the spectra data.
(2) Task mode: This is a deafult mode for running any task. 

**ML needs following files:**

(1) Conditions file (MonitorCalibrationConditions) <br>
(2) Timing file (MonitorCalibrationTiming) <br>
(3) Function to make the stimulus(makeStim.m) <br>

Associated files which need to be present in the task directory: <br>

(4) Alert function <br>
(5) Task related audio stimuli  <br>

**Note:** <br>
Every time you run the task, a .cfg file is created in the task directory. This has all the configuration details <br>
which are set in the control GUI. <br>

**Testing:** <br>
The task was tested on MonkeyLogic Version 2.2.32(Jan7,2023). <br>
If you are facing any issue while running the task, it might be related to the version of the monkeyLogic you are using. <br>
